Overview of Analysis 
The purpose of the following AWS Vine analysis was to discover whether a bias exists toward favorable reviews from paid Amazon Vine members. 
The following data is derived specifically from US Digital Ebook Purchases. Several data frames were created to showcase broad data: like the number of votes. Several filtered data frames were created to further explore the data in an effort to review the voting behavior of paid Amazon Vine reviewers and non – Vine reviewers.

Analysis Summary
Based on the results from several filtered data frames, there is no positivity bias for reviews of the US Digital Ebook within the Vine program. Due to there being no Vine reviews for this particular dataset, it would be useful to conduct a focused analysis on the non – Vine reviewers; i.e. breaking down the most popular genres, popular titles and percentage of 4 star reviews. This would not be for the purpose of validating Vine review
